id = "CVE-2023-6927"

# Per the RedHat bugzilla https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2255027 the fixed upstream version 
# of keycloak is 23.0.4; however, there isn't much detail to pin down which specific commits were involved in the fix
# and therefore it is difficult to say for certain which specific keycloak artifact is affected.
# Contacted RedHat via email and they replied that they believe these are the involved commits, but that it was a bit of a
# moving target so these may not be exhaustive:
# - https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/commit/2ba7a51da60d31870242a39c887b6dde84b86e6c
# - https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/commit/097d68c86b13c0fac07d6b411e0fa051b15a682c
