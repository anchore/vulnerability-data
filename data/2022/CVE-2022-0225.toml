# Per the RedHat bugzilla https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040268 there is know specific fixed version mentioned
# but it states that at least up through 16.1.0 is vulnerable.  In https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/24454 someone
# claimed that version 21 was still affected; however, the repro steps still showed 16.1.0 and a maintainer noted that 21
# was unsupported by that point and to file another issue if still reproduceable on the latest version.  No other issues were
# opened.  For now we will align with GitHub per https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fqc7-5xxc-ph7r and just set the affected
# range as <= 16.1.0; however, it would be good to attempt reproducing on later versions to see if a fix was actually made
# TODO: Try reproducing on versions later than 16.1.0 to determine if a fix was actually submitted
