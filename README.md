# Vulnerability Data Repository

This repository holds enriched vulnerability data that supplements existing vulnerability databases. The data here is processed by the [vulnerability-data-tools](https://github.com/anchore/vulnerability-data-tools) project to generate various output formats, including NVD-compatible data.

## About This Repository

This is an automatically updated repository containing structured vulnerability data. The data format is designed to capture rich information about vulnerabilities, which can then be transformed into formats like:
- NVD JSON
- OSV
- Custom formats as needed

## Using This Data

The data in this repository is automatically processed into NVD-compatible format in the [nvd-data-overrides](https://github.com/anchore/nvd-data-overrides) repository. If you're looking to use the enriched vulnerability data, that repository provides a more immediately usable format.
